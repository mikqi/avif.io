## Framework List
  
Now that you've learned how fantastic AVIF is, you may be asking yourself, "**How do I use AVIF images in frameworks?** Since AVIF is relatively new, the implementation must be super complicated and time-consuming!" The answer is simple:{" "} **Most Javascript front-end frameworks support AVIF natively** and rely on HTML and CSS implementation. To make sure we are not talking nonsense, we tested it with the following frameworks: 
<Checklist
  items={[
    "facebook/react",
    "vuejs/vue",
    "angular/angular",
    "vercel/next.js",
    "svelte/svelte",
    "nuxt/nuxt.js",
    "gatsbyjs/gatsby",
  ]}
  checked={true}
/>

## Other frameworks

In principle, other frameworks might work differently. We found out from our research that Meteor and Ember support AVIF files without additional configuration, but since we did not experiment with the latest version live, we list it here as "maybe works" until we were in the science lab. 

<Checklist
  items={[
    "meteor/meteor",
    "jashkenas/backbone",
    "polymer/polymer",
    "emberjs/ember.js",
  ]}
  checked={false}
/>

## Example code
  
This is the code we used to display the image below in React and Next.JS: 

<Syntax language="html">
  {`<picture>
    <source srcSet="/images/cloudflare-stats.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcSet="/images/cloudflare-stats.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="/images/cloudflare-stats.jpg" alt="avif in frameworks" />
  </picture>`}
</Syntax>
<Image url="react-avif" alt="using avif in react" />
<Image url="angular-avif" alt="using avif in angular" />


## Webpack File Loader

In some cases, especially with older versions and when using webpack, you may encounter some problems. Especially: 

<Syntax language="html">
  Module parse failed: Unexpected character ' ' (1:0) You may need an
  appropriate loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are
  configured to process this fail. See
  https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders
</Syntax>

Simply add the detection for AVIF files to the fileloader in your webpack.config.js: 

<Syntax language="javascript">
{`module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{
        test: /\.(png|jpe?g|gif|webp|avif)$/i,
        use: [{loader: 'file-loader'}]
      }]
  }
}`}
</Syntax>

## Automatic conversion
  
We could not find a plugin that converts the image to other sizes and formats such as AVIF to match the device of the client. Node.JS library Sharp implemented AVIF support, which might be a good choice for you. Have you ever encountered such a plugin? Have you had any good or bad experiences with it?
