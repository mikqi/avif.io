      "Sorry, this file type is not permitted for security reasons".{" "}
      <b>There is no official AVIF support. </b>
      However, WordPress needs AVIF for two reasons: First, technicians and end
      users often have to deal with web speed problems that are widespread with
      this CMS. Thus, due to its incredibly small file size, AVIF can contribute
      to faster loading without causing any quality loss.
      <br />
      Second, WordPress <b>is the world's most dominant CMS</b> with over 455
      million websites in 2020. This means that about 35% of the web is powered
      by WordPress. Further statistics of WordPress show that in November 2020
      over 409 million people view more than 20 billion pages every month.

      <H level={2} callback={callback} text="Official Support" />
      The WordPress core has implemented a security check for uploading files
      since version 4.7. This means that{" "}
      <b>
        WordPress checks the file extension of your uploaded files and rejects
        files that do not match their pattern
      </b>
      . Some will know this due to the restriction on uploading SVGs. The same
      applies to modern image formats. To date,{" "}
      <b>
        {" "}
        WordPress does not support viewing or uploading WebP images, AVIF images
        or other modern formats natively
      </b>
      . <br />
      We could argue that AVIF is a new extension. Considering that WebP is more
      than 10 years old, the question really arises whether WordPress will ever
      add support for modern image formats. Fortunately, there are several ways
      around this security check. If you are looking for an easy way to
      automatically generate images and offer the user the best, skip the next
      paragraphs and take a look at the plugin section.
      <H level={2} callback={callback} text="Mime Types" />
      WordPress restricts files that do not match its list of Internet media
      types, also known as
      <b>content types</b> or <b>mime-types</b>. The MIME type is a two-part
      identifier for file formats and format content that is transferred on the
      Internet. It is quite simple to explain: A media file consists of a type
      and a subtype that defines content and file extension. An HTML file has
      the mime type text/html, an jpg the mime type image/jpeg.
      <Image url="mimetype" alt="example showing mime types" />
      WordPress uses these mime types.{" "}
      <b>
        They have a list of files they allow and a list of files they do not
        allow.{" "}
      </b>
      There are several methods to change this behavior and add mime types. We
      recommend Solution 3.
      <H level={3} text="Solution 1: Functions.php" />
      Functions.php is a file that appears on every theme in WordPress and
      contains basic functionalities. You can open it by{" "}
      <b>going to Appearance and choosing the Theme Editor</b>. If a warning
      appears, confirm you know what you are doing. Select your active theme in
      the right sidebar, and below you will find all theme files listed,
      including functions.php.
      <Image
        url="functionsphp"
        alt="place where the functions.php is located"
      />
      Click to open the file and scroll down to the bottom. Create a new line
      after the end of the file, and add the following. This code will{" "}
      <b>allow you to upload AVIF files</b> just like you upload any other
      image. If you wish to add more support for all the new image formats out
      there in the wild, copy the code below.
      <Syntax language="php">
        {`function allow_modern_images( $mime_types ) {
  $mime_types['webp'] = 'image/webp';
  $mime_types['heic'] = 'image/heic';
  $mime_types['heif'] = 'image/heif';
  $mime_types['heics'] = 'image/heic-sequence';
  $mime_types['heifs'] = 'image/heif-sequence';
  $mime_types['avif'] = 'image/avif';
  $mime_types['avis'] = 'image/avif-sequence';
  return $mime_types
}
add_filter( 'upload_mimes', 'allow_modern_images', 1, 1 );`}
      </Syntax>
      <H level={3} text="Solution 2: FTP Upload" />
      Another way to bypass the restriction is to upload your files via FTP.{" "}
      <b>Connect to your server and drop your images in the upload folder</b>,
      where most of your current photos should be saved. If you don't know how
      to access your files directly, please ask your web host. Most providers
      offer great tutorials.
      <H level={3} text="Solution 3: Plugins" />
      There's a{" "}
      <b>considerable disadvantage when modifying the functions.php</b>. It's
      theme related. This means whenever you switch a theme or proceed to update
      your current one, the shortcode snippet will be gone. Multiple plugin
      solutions exist for this issue:
      <Link
        className="block"
        link="wordpress.org/plugins/wp-add-mime-types/"
        text="WP Add Mime Types"
        ext
      />
      <Link
        className="block"
        link="wordpress.org/plugins/blob-mimes/"
        text="Lord of the Files"
        ext
      />
      To quote: WordPress relies mostly on name-based validation when deciding
      whether or not to allow a particular file, leaving the door open for
      various kinds of attacks. Lord of the Files (previously known as "blob
      mimes") adds to this content-based validation and sanitizing, ensuring
      that files are what they say they are and safe for inclusion on your site.
      <Image
        url="mimetype-plugin"
        alt="screenshot of the mime type plugin website"
      />
      <H level={2} callback={callback} text="No automatic conversion" />
      Uploading images is a cool thing, but a colossal problem remains. For
      every image you want to serve to your users,{" "}
      <b>you need to convert it manually</b>
      .
      <Link text="Bulk converters like avif.io" link="/" /> offer a solution to
      convert multiple files. However,
      <Link
        text="using the HTML picture tag"
        link="/blog/tutorials/use-avif-in-html/"
      />
      remains.
      <br /> A simpler idea would be an image plugin that automatically converts
      images to modern formats and offers the best solution based on your user's
      browser.
      <b> We are currently working on creating an easy-to-use plugin</b> that
      will handle all these requests without you having to configure anything.
      Until then, do not hesitate to try other plugins. Unfortunately, none of
      these plugins supports avif yet, but WebP is also an advantage!
      <H level={2} callback={callback} text="Plugin Support and Summary" />
      As we said earlier, all major WordPress services and plugins for image
      optimization currently do not support AVIF. WordPress does not support
      AVIF files. WordPress does not even support WebP. <br />
      <b>We are currently creating a fantastic plugin for you.</b> In the
      meantime, you can still upload AVIF files by allowing the mime type or
      using an image plugin to at least use WebP. Just make sure you provide
      fallback images for older versions of Chrome. Or browsers that do not
      support avif yet, such as Firefox.
